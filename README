# PmMod

This directory contains the files to display pages in PmWiki according
to a modified default layout (changes made by Lance Bachmeier - all
changes are placed in the public domain, but the original code
continues to exist under its original license).

# Installation

Create the directory pmmod in pub/skins/. Configure PmWiki to use this
layout by setting the $Skin variable in local/config.php to `pmmod`:

```
$Skin = 'pmmod';
```

If you just want to change the logo, you can change the variable $PageLogoUrl
to the url location of your logo.

Modifications to the css can be made in pmmod.css and modifications to the
template can be made to pmmod.tmpl. No attempt has been made to make this a
mobile-friendly skin, so that is the most likely reason you will want to make
changes.
